# zyppyr
Zip up a whole directory of files to exactly 24.5Mbs for use on github. Comes with unzipper


# Usage

I originally made this for a yugioh card game because the images alone where 3.1 gbs

# Getting Started

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Donny-GUI/zyppyr.git
cd zyppyr
python zipper.py
```
